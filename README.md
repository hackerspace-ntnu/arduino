# Hackerspace NTNU - Arduino Code

Share your code with others, learn by examples and get inspiration for your
next project!

The goal of this repository is for each user to create their own folder, and
commit their personal arduino `.ino` files. It could be simple blinking hello
worlds, or more advanced circuits using multiple diodes, LCD-screens or other
stuff.
